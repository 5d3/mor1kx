             MAROCCHINO Pipeline Status & Plans

23 June 2015
  Initial variant of pipeline. The variant was converted from
CAPPUCCINO by the following steps:
  a) mor1kx_decode & mor1kx_decode_execute_cappuccino were combined
     into one mor1kx_decode_marocchino
  b) mor1kx_execute_alu and mor1kx_execute_ctrl_cappuccino were
     combined into one mor1kx_execute_marocchino
  c) LSU related operations and l.mf(t)spr processing were moved from
     CTRL stage to EXECUTE one. So LSU & CTRL modules were modified
     appropriately.
  d) CTRL-stage related registers were removed
  e) The logic for bubble generation, forwarding results, pipeline
     control signals generation were significantly simplified
  f) Exceptions are taken on WB-stage now
  g) WB registers were extended to handle flags and exceptions
     additionally to result
  h) Debug unit support was damaged

Further development plan
  - pipelined FETCH implementation
  - pipelined LSU implementation
  - pipelined integer multiplier implementation
  - revision and adaptation (if need) FPU pipelines
  - design reorder buffer
  - integration all module listed above
  - update debug unit support in CTRL-module
