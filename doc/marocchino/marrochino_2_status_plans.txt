             MAROCCHINO Pipeline Status & Plans

23 June 2015
  Initial variant of pipeline. The variant was converted from
CAPPUCCINO by the following steps:
  a) mor1kx_decode & mor1kx_decode_execute_cappuccino were combined
     into one mor1kx_decode_marocchino
  b) mor1kx_execute_alu and mor1kx_execute_ctrl_cappuccino were
     combined into one mor1kx_execute_marocchino
  c) LSU related operations and l.mf(t)spr processing were moved from
     CTRL stage to EXECUTE one. So LSU & CTRL modules were modified
     appropriately.
  d) CTRL-stage related registers were removed
  e) The logic for bubble generation, forwarding results, pipeline
     control signals generation were significantly simplified
  f) Exceptions are taken on WB-stage now
  g) WB registers were extended to handle flags and exceptions
     additionally to result
  h) Debug unit support was damaged


23 July 2015
  FETCH refactored. However, the main achievement is simplification
of logic for generation padv-* and exception processing.


14 August 2015
  Some improvement for fetch. As a result, we don't need "fetch_valid"
flag to control pipeline.


 6 September 2015
  Pipelined multiplier. Some adaptation for FPU pipelines. Move WB
latches into mor1kx_execute_marocchino to prepare implementation of
control for paralleled execution units. So, mor1kx_wbmux_marocchino
has been removed from design.


Primary TODOs:
  - design initial variant of control for paralleled units
  - pipelined LSU implementation
  - design reorder buffer
  - update debug unit support in CTRL-module

Secondary TODOs:
  - Various improvements for performance of new FETCH

Permanently:
  - Adaptation FPU pipelines
